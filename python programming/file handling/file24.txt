I see them so clearly

The dirty hands of an artist

Was I your muse?

Your treasure trove of inspiration

The subject of your most beautiful work

Or was I the canvas?

Fated to be torn and battered

Covered with layer after layer

Those dirty hands of yours

Did they create or destroy?

I fear I donâ€™t remember

For your dirty hands have crafted memories

Memories that are not mind

And placed them in my head

Oh artist, how you deceive me so

You and your dirty hands
